# So You Wanna Code

This is Andrew Janke's little idea for a learning program for people who want to become coders, with an eye toward getting a job in programming.
It's aimed at adults considering a career change, but would also be appropriate for self-directed student-age learners.

I am a programmer; I am not a teacher of programming.
This is just some stuff I threw together based on my experience as a programmer.
YMMV.
