# TODOs for So You Wanna Code

* Student Mac system specs
  * Are we gonna require running local VMs?
    * It's like a $500-$800 cost difference to get from a minimum 2-core MacBook to a 4-core one that could run local VMs. That's significant.
* SOC 101 curriculum
* Pick additional books
  * JavaScript/web dev books
* Choose AsciiDoc or Markdown for actual course pages
  * <https://github.com/asciidoctor/jekyll-asciidoc> - can use AsciiDoc with GitHub Pages
