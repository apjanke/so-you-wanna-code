# TODOs for So You Wanna Code

* Student Mac system specs
  * Are we gonna require running local VMs?
    * It's like a $500-$800 cost difference to get from a minimum 2-core MacBook to a 4-core one that could run local VMs. That's significant.
* SOC 101 curriculum
* Section on FLOSS (movement and pragmatics)
* Ergonomics reading materials
  * Oof, this one's gonna be a hard one
* Pick additional books
  * JavaScript/web dev books
  * Add dataviz books to the Data Science course

* PROJ 201: Project Management curriculum
  * Follow up on Simeon's recommendations
  * CAPM from Project Management Institute?
  * Read <https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/10762-best-project-management-certifications.html>
* Research certifications for GCP and AWS
  * Consider switching to AWS, for job prospect reasons
* More diversity in reading sources?
