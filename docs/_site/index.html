<p>This is Andrew Janke’s little idea for a learning program for people who want to become coders, with an eye toward getting a job in programming.
It’s aimed at adults considering a career change, but would also be appropriate for self-directed student-age learners.</p>

<p>I am a programmer; I am not a teacher of programming.
This is just some stuff I threw together based on my experience as a programmer.
Effectively, this is what I would do if I were just learning how to program now.
Nobody has done this program yet, so I have no idea how well it’s going to work.
YMMV.</p>

<p>This is an outline of a learning program.
It is not an actual course.
It will recommend things for you to learn, and suggest where you can do that, but will not actually teach you these things.
The intent is for this to act as a cheap DIY introduction to programming for self-learners, which could prepare you for further self-study or as a head start on a more formal “boot camp” or other training program.
It’s also a way to get a taste of what programming is like, so you can decide if it’s for you before you commit the time and money to do a formal training program.</p>

<h2 id="whats-in-here">What’s in here</h2>

<p>See <a href="course-outline-ideas.html">Course Outline Ideas</a> for what I’ve come up with so far for a basic course outline.
<a href="ImportantResources.html">Important Resources</a> has links to additional resources.</p>

<p>This program focuses on Python, JavaScript/web dev, and some other “general” programming stuff like Java, C, and SQL. It uses Macs for local dev machines and Google Cloud Platform for cloud stuff. It’s intended to be low cost, and especially low-up-front cost, so you can decide it’s not for you and bail at any time without having sunk a lot of money and effort into it.</p>

<h2 id="effort-and-cost">Effort and Cost</h2>

<p>The program lays out about 3 to 8 months of learning activity, but it’s all self-paced, so you can go faster or slower.</p>

<p>You’ll need to buy some books and services to do the program, which will run you between $700 and $1,200 (depending on how many of the optional stuff you do).
In addition, you’ll need an okay computer, preferably a Mac laptop, which can cost $800 to $1,500 if you don’t have one already.</p>

<p>Most of the costs are pay-as-you go; you’ll need to lay out about $300 up front for the initial materials (and it’s mostly for stuff you should have anyway, even if you’re not going to become a coder).</p>

<p>You can find a list of program materials and costs as the <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CVBE83diSe63xbfDdTgHKiyhSbVYcnAWUjlKcRUs_OQ/edit?usp=sharing">“So You Wanna Code - Materials and Costs” Google Sheet</a>.</p>
