# TODOs for So You Wanna Code

* Change theme to one with larger, black text? friendly-coders thought it was hard to read.
* Student Mac system specs
  * Are we gonna require running local VMs?
    * It's like a $500-$800 cost difference to get from a minimum 2-core MacBook to a 4-core one that could run local VMs. That's significant. Let's at least delay that requirement until it's time to run VMs or do a compiled language.
* SOC 101 curriculum
* Section on FLOSS (movement and pragmatics)
  * Maybe this should go in a SOC course?
* Put an explicit Unit Testing and CI section in somewhere
* Ergonomics reading materials
  * Oof, this one's gonna be a hard one
* Pick additional books
  * JavaScript/web dev books
* PROJ 201: Project Management curriculum
  * Follow up on Simeon's recommendations
  * CAPM from Project Management Institute?
  * Read <https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/10762-best-project-management-certifications.html>
* Research certifications for GCP and AWS
  * Consider switching to AWS, for job prospect reasons
* Review "21st Century C" as an alternative to K&R
* More diversity in reading sources?
  * Current list is pretty white and male
* Do the CS50 Understanding Tech course
* Start work on CS50 Intro to Programming
* An item on meditation in PRAG 102 or 201?
* Some personal finance stuff in PRAG
* Job search stuff
  * How to actually locate and research employers
  * How to contact recruiters
