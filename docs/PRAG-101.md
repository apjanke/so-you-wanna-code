# PRAG 101: Setting up as a Dev

Time: 1 week

## Prep for this course

* Join the "Lovelace Café" Discord
  * This is Andrew's Discord for people doing this program. Ask him for an invite.
  * (The Lovelace Café is restricted to Andrew's personal friends, so I don't have to worry about moderation.)

## Preparing to comptooter safely

* Read my [Practical OpSec page](Practical-OpSec.html) and follow its advice

## Setting up your identity

* Choose your "handle"
  * This is your online nickname. You'll use it for your domain, and your account names on all these services.
  * Choose wisely! This is the name the public and potential employers and collaborators will see you through, and you might be stuck with this for a long time.
  * No, really. Take some time and think about this, and choose this first, before going on to the next steps.
* Buy a domain
  * Probably use your handle for or in your domain name.
  * Run your domain name by Andrew before actually buying it.
  * Use [Hover](https://hover.com) as your domain registrar
* Set up email on your domain
  * Just use GMail with a forward. It's free and good.
* Create accounts and set up your profiles on:
  * [GitHub](https://github.com/)
  * [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com)
  * [edX](https://www.edx.org)
  * [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/)
  * [DEV](https://dev.to)
  * [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org)
  * [Slashdot](https://slashdot.org)
  * [Google](https://www.google.com/account/about)/[GMail](https://gmail.com)
  * [Feedly](https://feedly.com)
  * [Reddit](https://reddit.com)
  * [Matrix](https://matrix.org)
  * [Twitter](https://twitter.com)
    * This'll be your dev Twitter, not your face/personal Twitter. Keep 'em separate for now.
  * [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com)
  * [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in)
  * [Pocket](https://getpocket.com)
  * And maybe:
    * [A Cloud Guru](https://acloud.guru/)
    * [Linux Academy](https://linuxacademy.com/)
  * And use your handle for your username on all of these
