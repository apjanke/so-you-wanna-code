# So You Wanna Code

This is Andrew Janke's little idea for a learning program for people who want to become coders, with an eye toward getting a job in programming.
It's aimed at adults considering a career change, but would also be appropriate for self-directed student-age learners.

I am a programmer; I am not a teacher of programming.
This is just some stuff I threw together based on my experience as a programmer.
YMMV.

## What's in here

See [course-outline-ideas.md] for what I've come up with so far for a basic course outline.
[ImportantResources.md] has links to additional resources.

This program focuses on Python, JavaScript/web dev, and some other "general" programming stuff like Java, C, and SQL. It uses Macs for local dev machines and Google Cloud Platform for cloud stuff. It's intended to be low cost, and especially low-up-front cost, so you can decide it's not for you and bail at any time without having sunk a lot of money and effort into it.

## Effort and Cost

The program lays out about 3-4 months of learning activity, but it's all self-paced, so you can go faster or slower.

You'll need to buy some books and services to do the program, which will run you between $700 and $1,200 (depending on how many of the optional stuff you do).
In addition, you'll need an okay computer, preferably a Mac laptop, which can cost $800 to $1,500 if you don't have one already.

You can find a list of program materials and costs as the ["So You Wanna Code - Materials and Costs" Google Sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1CVBE83diSe63xbfDdTgHKiyhSbVYcnAWUjlKcRUs_OQ/edit?usp=sharing).
