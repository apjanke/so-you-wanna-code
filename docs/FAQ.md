# So You Wanna Code FAQ

"FAQ" stands for "Frequently Asked Questions". That's just a conventional name: these questions have not in fact been frequently asked. But I'm answering them anyway.

## Why is Linux "not recommended"?

Several reasons.

First off, desktop Linux requires more administration work than Mac or Windows. I don't want to ask that of my students, and at a desktop level, I'm not prepared to support it. And it's risky. Even in 2020, you can have bad luck with a `sudo apt-get updgrade` run and end up with an unusable system. So, no.

Second, expense. The students coming to this program are going to be Normal People who have their entire computer lives in the Windows or Apple ecosystems. I'm not going to ask them to repave their primary computer and put Linux on it and try to move their lives over there. So getting them to run Linux would require them to either buy another computer to run Linux on (expensive) or dual-boot Linux on their primary machine (effortful and risky).

Third, aesthetics. Many of my students are coming from arts and design backgrounds, and have high aesthetic standards. It's 2020 and Linux on the desktop is still ugly. (Yes, I see you, ElementaryOS, and you're making good progress! Keep trying, buddy!)

Fourth, vocational. The mainstream business world runs on Windows on the desktop, and the designy/creative world has some Macs in there. Linux on the desktop is an oddity. Students should prepare for what they will use on the job.

Finally, on a social level, the GNU/Linux community can be prickly and condescending, and unwelcoming to novices. So I want to steer my students away from that for their initial experiences with programming, so they don't have a bad experience and sour on being a coder. And, to a lesser extent, the egotism and ideological zealotry among some GNU/Linux folks is not typical of software development out in industry, and I don't want my students to get the wrong impression of what coding is like.
