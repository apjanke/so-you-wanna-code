# TODOs for So You Wanna Code

* Change theme to one with larger, black text? friendly-coders thought it was hard to read.

* Expectations essay
* SOC 101 curriculum
* Add some Technical Writing stuff
  * This should probably be integrated throughout the program, instead of as a discrete course
* Use Microsoft OneDrive instead of Google Drive?
  * Seems like I'm going to lean toward Microsoft/Azure stuff, so this might integrate well
  * 5 GB is free; $25 gets you 100 GB; $70 gets you 1 TB _plus_ Office with Microsoft 365
* Section on FLOSS (movement and pragmatics)
  * Maybe this should go in a SOC course?
  * Warn about the GNU/Linux scene's prickliness
* Put an explicit Unit Testing and CI section in somewhere
* Ergonomics reading materials
  * Oof, this one's gonna be a hard one
* An item on meditation in PRAG 102 or 201?
* Pick additional books
  * JavaScript/web dev books
* PROJ 201: Project Management curriculum
  * Follow up on Simeon's recommendations
  * CAPM from Project Management Institute?
  * Read <https://www.businessnewsdaily.com/10762-best-project-management-certifications.html>
* Research certifications for Azure, GCP and AWS
  * Consider switching to Azure or AWS, for job prospect reasons; GCP is only like 5% market share
* More diversity in reading sources?
  * Current list is pretty white and male
* Start work on CS50 Intro to Programming
* Some more personal finance stuff in PRAG
* Job search stuff
  * How to actually locate and research employers
  * How to contact recruiters
  * Resume construction advice
    * With special concerns for new-career-switcher programmers
